    Every time a SplitReceiver entity is updated, a corresponding SplitReceiver\Log

    user, but it can be retrieved to check additional information
    on the SplitReceiver.

    ## Attributes (return-only):
        - id [string]: unique id returned when the log is created. ex: "5656565656565656"
        - splitReceiver [SplitReceiver]: SplitReceiver entity to which the log refers to.
        - errors [array of strings]: array of errors linked to this SplitReceiver event
        - type [string]: type of the SplitReceiver event which triggered the log creation. ex: "success" or "failed"
        - created [DateTime]: creation datetime for the log.
